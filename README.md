Iceflair is an Android application developed using Java and Android Studio to enhance public safety by facilitating wildfire and black ice reporting. The app integrates Google Maps API and Google Directions API, allowing users and government services to report and visualize incidents in real time.

Users can submit detailed reports by filling out a form with information such as the type of incident (wildfire or black ice), the date, and the location. For wildfires, the form includes the size of the fire, while black ice incidents require users to highlight affected roads. Media attachments such as photos or videos can be added to support reports. Once submitted, incidents are plotted on Google Maps. Wildfires are represented as a pinpoint at the center with a circle indicating the size, while black ice hazards are visualized as highlighted roads.

The app features a summary dashboard, offering a compact view of all reported incidents, including essential details such as the type, date, and location. Additionally, Iceflair includes an emergency preparedness feature, providing tailored checklists for wildfires and black ice. These checklists outline critical safety items and actions, which users can share via email to ensure preparedness during emergencies.

By combining advanced mapping capabilities with real-time data from users and authorities, Iceflair fosters collaboration, enabling efficient monitoring and response to environmental hazards. Its intuitive design and robust functionality make it an essential tool for enhancing public safety and environmental awareness.
